# CTFA: CTF Parameter Estimation Software for Cryo-EM

CTFA is a CTF (Contrast Transfer Function) parameter estimation software designed for cryo-EM images. The name CTFA combines CTF with TFA (Time-Frequency Analysis), reflecting its innovative integration of these methodologies. It excels in processing micrographs captured with small defocus and phase plates, paving the path to high-resolution cryo-ET.
